Jitsi-meet with Breakout rooms
v 1.0
***************************************************************************************************

*** To start, stop or restart the services, use:
. /additional-config/scripts/start-all.sh
. /additional-config/scripts/stop-all.sh
. /additional-config/scripts/restart-all.sh

*** Breakout rooms website
The web interface is available at https://[host]/ws/moderator.html
The web resources can be modified in the folder /docker-websocket/public . 
The folder /docker-websocket/public is shared with a docker container running a node.js websocket
and serving the web resources.
Changes to the web resources are immediately reflected after browser reload

*** Jitsi meet installation
Nginx and Jitsi interface files can be modified in /additional-config/
Running the restart-all.sh script or start-all.sh script copies the ngingx and jitsi files to 
the jitsi-web container and (re)starts the services.
The /config folder is shared with the running jitsi docker instances. Copying a file to this folder 
shares it with the docker instances, but it may need a restart of the container to pick up the file.
/config/web is shared with the jitsi web server
/config/jvb with the jitsi video bridge
etc.

*** SSL certificate renewal
The SSL certificate is created and renewed by certbot. Certbot has a rate limiter of 5 renewals / week.
A cron job runs every week, renewing the certificate. It can be manually run with the script:
. /additional-config/scripts/renew-ssl.sh  
This can be customized in the crontab with crontab -e

*** Restart services
The jitsi video conferencing software can get slower after several week of uptime. 
To remedy this, the script . /additional-config/scripts/restart-all.sh  runs every day at 00:00 UTC. This can be customized
in the cron tab with crontab -e
